This is a project to maintain a survey of existing and proposed laws and regulations on cryptography - systems used for protecting information against unauthorized access. Governments have long restricted export of cryptography on national security grounds, and with the wider availability of cryptographic tools concerns have also been raised about criminals using cryptography to thwart law enforcement. For these reasons, many countries have passed laws or are considering laws to maintain law-enforcement and national-security capabilities through regulation of cryptography.

This project was initiated by individual participants of the [OpenChain Export Control Work Group](https://lists.openchainproject.org/g/export-control-wg) in an effort to take the great work from Bert-Jaap Koops' [Crypto Law Survey](http://www.cryptolaw.org/) and provide a way for the resource to easily accept new contributions from around the world.

This is not an official resource of the OpenChain Project, but rather one that is being discussed and organized by individuals via an OpenChain mailing list.

## Participate

You can join the OpenChain Export Control Work Group mailing list or the Slack workspace of the [OpenChain](https://www.openchainproject.org) project from the [participation page](https://www.openchainproject.org/participate).

## Disclaimer

This survey of cryptography laws is based on information gathered from the Internet and personal communication initited by Bert-Jaap Koops. We have not consulted all original texts of relevant regulations and in many cases, we have relied on the sources listed. This means that the resource is inteded to help set some context but it does not pretend to be exhaustive or accurate, and nothing here is legal advice. Your organization is responsible for its actions with respect to export control regulations. You must discuss your specific use-case and make decisions under the advice of your legal team.
