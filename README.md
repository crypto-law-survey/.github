This organization aims at maintaining the survey of existing and proposed laws and regulations on cryptography - systems used for protecting information against unauthorized access. Governments have long restricted export of cryptography for fear that their intelligence activities are hampered by the crypto use of foreign states and scoundrels. Since the rise of crypto use over the past decades, governments increasingly worry about criminals using cryptography to thwart law enforcement. Thus, many countries have passed laws or are considering laws to maintain law-enforcement and national-security capabilities through regulation of cryptography.

It is initiated by the [OpenChain](https://www.openchainproject.org/) in an effort to take the great work from Bert-Jaap Koops' [Crypto Law Survey](http://www.cryptolaw.org/) and propulse it further on and aims to get a life of its own.

## Participate

Please join the Export Control mailing list and the Slack workspace of the [OpenChain](https://www.openchainproject.org/) project from the [participation page](https://www.openchainproject.org/participate)... and the corresponding Channel in our Slack workspace.

## Disclaimer

This survey of cryptography laws is based on several reports, information from the Internet and personal communications. We have not consulted all original texts of relevant regulations; in many cases, we have relied on the sources listed. These findings, therefore, do not pretend to be exhaustive or legally reliable.
